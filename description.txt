**Development on this mod will end here, beyond a few bug fixes and minor changes I won't be able to focus on this mod anymore inbetween school and work as I was doing this entirely free of charge. Thank you for joining me on this journey**

This mod adds new mobs, items, and bosses. 
Most of the items are jokes but there is three sets for the melee, magic, and range class that evolves with you as you progress throughout the game.
You need to constantly update it and work on it so you can be as strong as possible.
