If you're interested in supporting me in the development of this mod consider donating to my patreon with the link both in my discord and on the mod's wiki page.
Donating will help me continue making content that I love to make without worrying about ending up on the street cuz I'm a broke boy.
Thank you all so much for supporting my mod and helping me pass 30,000 downloads. Here's to 30,000 more!
